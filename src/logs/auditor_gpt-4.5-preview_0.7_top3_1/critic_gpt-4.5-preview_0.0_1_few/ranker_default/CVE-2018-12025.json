The condition 'if(allowed[from][msg.sender] >= value) return false;' is indeed inverted, causing legitimate transfers with sufficient allowance to fail and allowing transfers with insufficient allowance to proceed. This is a severe logic flaw that directly contradicts the intended ERC-20 functionality. However, the reasoning incorrectly suggests that an attacker could exploit this to manipulate or block transfers maliciously. In reality, this flaw primarily results in legitimate transactions failing, causing denial-of-service rather than enabling profitable exploitation. Thus, while correctness is high, severity is moderate (due to denial-of-service potential), and profitability is very low as no direct financial gain is achievable by an attacker.",

It rejects transactions when the allowance is sufficient, and allows transactions only if the allowance is lower than the requested value, contradicting the intended functionality. An attacker or malicious user could exploit this logic to deny legitimate token transfers approved by users, effectively blocking or manipulating token transfers and approvals. To fix this vulnerability, the condition should be 'if(allowed[from][msg.sender] < value) return false;' which correctly checks and allows transfers only if the spender has sufficient allowance.",

In reality, only the current owner can trigger this issue, making it more of a potential accidental or social-engineering risk rather than a direct external exploit.

An attacker or malicious actor could trick the owner or exploit weaknesses in off-chain procedures to set the owner address to zero, causing permanent loss of administrative control. To fix this vulnerability, the function should include a zero address check such as 'require(new_owner != address(0));' ensuring ownership can only be transferred to a valid, controlled address.",
