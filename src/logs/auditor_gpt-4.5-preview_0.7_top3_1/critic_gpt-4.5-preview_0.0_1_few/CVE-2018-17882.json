The transferFrom function explicitly skips the allowance check when transferring tokens to the special address 'fights'. This allows an attacker to transfer tokens from any user's account to the 'fights' address without authorization. The severity is high because it enables unauthorized token transfers, potentially draining user balances. However, profitability depends on the attacker's control or influence over the 'fights' address. If the attacker does not control this address, direct financial gain is limited. Thus, profitability is moderate, contingent on the attacker's ability to benefit from tokens sent to the special address.",
