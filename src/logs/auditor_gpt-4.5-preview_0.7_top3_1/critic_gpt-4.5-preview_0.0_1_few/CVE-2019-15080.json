The function 'owned' was clearly intended as a constructor but due to a naming typo ('owned' instead of 'Owned'), it became a publicly callable function. This allows any attacker to call it at any time after deployment, effectively hijacking ownership. This vulnerability is severe because ownership typically grants critical privileges such as minting, burning, or blacklisting accounts. The severity is very high as it completely compromises the contract's security model. Profitability is also high because an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain full control over the contract and potentially extract significant financial gain.",

The described scenario is accurate: an attacker can front-run approval transactions to spend both the old and new allowances. However, the severity and profitability of this vulnerability are context-dependent. In practice, this vulnerability is mitigated by common wallet practices (setting allowance to zero first) and user awareness. Thus, while the correctness is high, the severity is moderate, and profitability is moderate as well, since exploiting this vulnerability requires precise timing and monitoring of the mempool, making it somewhat challenging to exploit consistently.",

If a user changes an allowance from a non-zero value to another non-zero value, the spender might spend both the previous and new allowance by front-running the approval transaction.
